# | C) 2025-08-13 - ∞          | reception date     | empty          |
#
# After 2026-04-23 (one year after C started), the file creation date
# for all first-year committers will match the reception date,
# while everybody else will have been a committer for more than one year.
# This means the code can then be simplified to just
# check if the file creation date is in the last year.
#
# For now however, the code needs to check if the file creation date
# is before 2025-07-17 to distinguish between periods A and C,
# so we hardcode that date for the code to use.
